We used a dataset from kaggle.com containing information about 200 students and their schedule, particularly amount of sleep hours and amount of hours spent studying .

## Main Idea

The main idea of the project is to create code for analyzing characteristics of various students to identify patterns in their studies.

## Project Tasks

•	Data cleaning and conversion to dictionary

•	Searching the dependence of students' attendance on the amount of sleep, creating the plot with the trend line

•	Searching the dependence of students' examination mark on the amount of sleep, creating the plot with the trend line

•	Searching for dependence of students' examination mark on the amount of studying hours, creating the plot with the trend line

•	The analysis of the resulting charts

## Authors

The project was completed in October 2025 by 2nd-year FGGT students Daria Zubkova, Mikhail Davydov and Pavel Baranov. Daria was responsible for creating plots according to parameters and its analysis, Mikhail handled data cleaning and visualizations, Pavel created the design and description of the code.
